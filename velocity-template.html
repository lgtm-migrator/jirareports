  <p>Hi all,<br><br>

    This is the velocity report from the most recent sprint.</p><br>

  <p style="font-size:11px">(The green line represents the number of hours that we currently have in scope for the next release. The yellow line represents the cumulative work each team has done. The point at which they intersect is when we have completed the version. The green line will fluctuate as we add or remove items to the scope of the version and as we refine large jobs into multiple smaller ones, whilst the yellow line will vary depending on resourcing and other factors.)</p>
